# Mobile Store
This project is in production and available via the following link! [Mobile Store](https://valodmobile.netlify.app/)  

The Mobile Store project is developed in React.js and features the following essential functionalities:
- filtered search
- intuitive slider
- sign-in and sign-up
- easy cart management and seamless checkout
- 5-star rating system
- route navigation simplifying user experience

I've used Redux.js for efficient state management and local storage for database.  

After cloning the repository, in the project root directory you can run  

`npm run dev`  

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.  

Have fun!
