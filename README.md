# Mobile Store
This project is in production and available via the following link! [Mobile Store](https://valodmobile.netlify.app/)  

The Mobile Store project is developed in React.js and features the following essential functionalities:
- filtered search
- sign-in and sign-up
- intuitive slider
- easy cart management and seamless checkout
- route navigation that simplifies user experience

I've used Redux.js for efficient state management and local storage for the database.  

After cloning the repository, in the project root directory you can run  

`npm run dev`  

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.  

Have fun!
